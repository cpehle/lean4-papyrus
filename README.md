# Papyrus

An **work-in-progress** LLVM interface for Lean 4.

Inspired by (and including code derived from) [`lean-llvm`](https://github.com/GaloisInc/lean-llvm), which is Copyright (c) 2019 Galois, Inc. and released under the Apache 2.0 license, which can be found here: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.

More documentation will come as development progresses. In fact, the source files are pretty well documented already (if I do say so myself), so feel free to take a look at them.
